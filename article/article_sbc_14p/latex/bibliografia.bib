    abstract = {It has been said many times that the statements provided by Financial Accounting do not give a picture of certain realities of companies nowadays, considering the fact that, often, the accounting value of shares is below their market value. This contrast between the two values is being identified as Intellectual Capital and presented as a new concept of business administration that leads to the necessity of applying new strategies, a new management philosophy and new ways of company valuation. This article demonstrates the relation that actually exists between Accountancy and Intellectual Capital. The novelty of the concept is demystified since it is proven that Intellectual Capital constitutes a component part of Goodwill, a concept that has been known and studied by Accountancy for ages. The intangible elements have always been dealt with by Accountancy and, in the same way as their importance has never been disregarded, their complexity has never been underestimated. Therefore, Accountancy is not defective in its publication of the information it registers. The purpose of each of the Financial Statements must be understood, as well as the Principles on which they are built. Sometimes, the lack of knowledge leads to precipitated and erroneous conclusions. On the other hand, whichever the label attributed to the intangible elements, which have always been a part of organizations, it is understood and accepted that, nowadays, the knowledge about and administration of these elements are more and more relevant for company management, since the current time is characterized by the widespread application of the knowledge resource by man, which is materialized into new technologies, systems and services (understood as intangible assets) that add value to the organizations.},

@inproceedings{ristenpart2010randomness,
    abstract = {Random number generators (RNGs) are consistently a weak link in the secure use of cryptography. Routine cryptographic operations such as encryption and signing can fail spectacularly given predictable or repeated randomness, even when using good long-lived key material. This has proved problematic in prior settings when RNG implementation bugs, poor design, or low-entropy sources have resulted in predictable randomness. We investigate a new way in which RNGs fail due to reuse of virtual machine (VM) snapshots. We exhibit such VM reset vulnerabilities in widely-used TLS clients and servers: the attacker takes advantage of (or forces) snapshot replay to compromise sessions or even expose a server's DSA signing key. Our next contribution is a backwards-compatible framework for hedging routine cryptographic operations against bad randomness, thereby mitigating the damage due to randomness failures. We apply our framework to the OpenSSL library and experimentally confirm that it has little overhead.},

As we have come to rely on these systems to process and store data, we have also come to wonder about their ability to protect valuable data. Data security is the science and study of methods of protecting data in computer and communication systems from unauthorized disclosure and modification. The goal of this book is to introduce the mathematical principles of data security and to show how these principles apply to operating systems, database systems, and computer networks. The book is for students and professionals seeking an introduction to these principles. There are many references for those who would like to study specific topics further. Data security has evolved rapidly since 1975. We have seen exciting developments in cryptography: public-key encryption, digital signatures, the Data Encryption Standard (DES), key safeguarding schemes, and key distribution protocols. We have developed techniques for verifying that programs do not leak confidential data, or transmit classified data to users with lower security clearances. We have found new controls for protecting data in statistical databases-and new methods of attacking these databases. We have come to a better understanding of the theoretical and practical limitations to security.},

    abstract = {The comparison of night styles and flight parameters of migrating raptors in Israel revealed the following, (1) Climbing rate in thermal circling did not differ between species, indicating that chiefly the strength of thermal updrafts determined the climbing rate and that morphological features were less relevant, (2) In interthermal gliding, air speed was positively and gliding angle negatively related to the species' average body mass, Heavier species glided faster and had smaller gliding angles. (3) In soaring and gliding flight, crosscountry speed relative to the air was positively related to the species' body mass; it was obviously the result of the gliding ability increasing with body mass, (4) Eagles and buzzards used soaring and gliding flight for more than 95{\%} of the observation time, Additional soaring in a straight line whilst gliding was extensively used by the Steppe Eagle Aquila nipalensis, Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina and Booted Eagle Hieraoetus pennatus and even more frequently by the resident species, the Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus and Short-toed Eagle Circaetus gallicus. Smaller species, such as the Levant Sparrowhawk Accipiter brevipes, harriers (Circus sp.) and small falcons (Falco sp.), showed the highest proportion of napping and gliding night (9-33{\%}), (5) In a comparison of the flight parameters and proportions of flight styles, a cluster analysis distinguished two main groups: The first consisted of Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus, Pallid Harrier Circus macrourus, Levant Sparrowhawk and small falcons; their flight behaviour was characterized by both the high proportion of napping and the low gliding performance, The second group comprised the typical soaring migrants: Steppe Eagle, Lesser Spotted Eagle, Booted Eagle, Steppe Buzzard Buteo buteo vulpinus, Honey Buzzard Pernis apivorus and Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus, and they had very similar night behaviour and were closely clustered, The Black Kite A Milvus miguans and Marsh Harrier Circus aeruginosus were intermediate between typical soarers and flappers, The two resident species, Griffon Vulture and Short-toed Eagle, were grouped separately from the soaring migrants.},

Internet and networks applications are growing very fast, so the importance and the value of the exchanged data over the internet or other media types are increasing. Hence the search for the best solution to offer the necessary protection against the data intruders' attacks along with providing these services in time is one of the most interesting subjects in the security related communities. Cryptography is the one of the main categories of computer security that converts information from its normal form into an unreadable form. The two main characteristics that identify and differentiate one encryption algorithm from another are its ability to secure the protected data against attacks and its speed and efficiency in doing so. This paper provides a fair comparison between three most common symmetric key cryptography algorithms: DES, AES, and Blowfish. Since main concern here is the performance of algorithms under different settings, the presented comparison takes into consideration the behavior and the performance of the algorithm when different data loads are used. The comparison is made on the basis of these parameters: speed, block size, and key size. Simulation program is implemented using Java programming.},

The key resists cryptanalysis even against an attacker who captures all system information related to generating or verifying the cryptographic key. Moreover, the technique is sufficiently robust to enable the user to reliably regenerate the key by uttering her password again. We describe an empirical evaluation of this technique using 250 utterances recorded from 50 users.},

    abstract = { Instead of using PINs and passwords as cryptographic keys that are either easy to forget or vulnerable to dictionary attacks, easy-to-carry and difficult-to-transfer keys can be generated based on user-specific biometric information. A framework is proposed to generate stable cryptographic keys from biometric data that is unstable in nature. The proposed framework differs from prior work in that user-dependent transforms are utilized to generate more compact and distinguishable features. Thereby, a longer and more stable bitstream can be generated as the cryptographic key. Experiments are performed on a face database to verify the feasibility of the proposed framework. The preliminary result is very encouraging.},

@article{ruttor2007neural,
    abstract = {Neural networks can synchronize by learning from each other. In the case of discrete weights full synchronization is achieved in a finite number of steps. Additional networks can be trained by using the inputs and outputs generated during this process as examples. Several learning rules for both tasks are presented and analyzed. In the case of Tree Parity Machines synchronization is much faster than learning. Scaling laws for the number of steps needed for full synchronization and successful learning are derived using analytical models. They indicate that the difference between both processes can be controlled by changing the synaptic depth. In the case of bidirectional interaction the synchronization time increases proportional to the square of this parameter, but it grows exponentially, if information is transmitted in one direction only. Because of this effect neural synchronization can be used to construct a cryptographic key-exchange protocol. Here the partners benefit from mutual interaction, so that a passive attacker is usually unable to learn the generated key in time. The success probabilities of different attack methods are determined by numerical simulations and scaling laws are derived from the data. They show that the partners can reach any desired level of security by just increasing the synaptic depth. Then the complexity of a successful attack grows exponentially, but there is only a polynomial increase of the effort needed to generate a key. Further improvements of security are possible by replacing the random inputs with queries generated by the partners.},

@article{allam2010improvement,
    abstract = {Neural cryptography deals with the problem of {\&}x201C;key exchange{\&}x201D; between two neural networks using the mutual learning concept. The two networks exchange their outputs (in bits) and the key between the two communicating parties is eventually represented in the final learned weights, when the two networks are said to be synchronized. Security of neural synchronization is put at risk if an attacker is capable of synchronizing with any of the two parties during the training process. Therefore, diminishing the probability of such a threat improves the reliability of exchanging the output bits through a public channel. The synchronization with feedback algorithm is one of the existing algorithms that enhances the security of neural cryptography. This paper proposes three new algorithms to enhance the mutual learning process. They mainly depend on disrupting the attacker confidence in the exchanged outputs and input patterns during training. The first algorithm is called {\&}x201C;Do not Trust My Partner{\&}x201D; (DTMP), which relies on one party sending erroneous output bits, with the other party being capable of predicting and correcting this error. The second algorithm is called {\&}x201C;Synchronization with Common Secret Feedback{\&}x201D; (SCSFB), where inputs are kept partially secret and the attacker has to train its network on input patterns that are different from the training sets used by the communicating parties. The third algorithm is a hybrid technique combining the features of the DTMP and SCSFB. The proposed approaches are shown to outperform the synchronization with feedback algorithm in the time needed for the parties to synchronize.},

    abstract = {Different scaling properties for the complexity of bidirectional synchronization and unidirectional learning are essential for the security of neural cryptography. Incrementing the synaptic depth of the networks increases the synchronization time only polynomially, but the success of the geometric attack is reduced exponentially and it clearly fails in the limit of infinite synaptic depth. This method is improved by adding a genetic algorithm, which selects the fittest neural networks. The probability of a successful genetic attack is calculated for different model parameters using numerical simulations. The results show that scaling laws observed in the case of other attacks hold for the improved algorithm, too. The number of networks needed for an effective attack grows exponentially with increasing synaptic depth. In addition, finite-size effects caused by Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning are analyzed. These learning rules converge to the random walk rule if the synaptic depth is small compared to the square root of the system size.},
